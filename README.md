# Vibrations and Control Virtual Lab
This repository includes translational, rotational, and control labs
You can download and run simulations on MATLAB R2021b or newer versions of MATLAB. 
<p>
You can also run simulations using MATLAB Online. The virtual labs can be utilized in undergraduate level Mechanical Vibrations, Control Theory and their associated laboratories.

#### The learning objectives that are tied to the virtual labs are:
- Determine the natural frequency of SDOF
- Determine the natural frequnecies of MDOF
- Observe how the initial displacement of each mass affects the free vibration for a system with multi degrees of freedom
- Design a dynamic absorber and test to see how well your design works
- Identify the benefits of an absorber design
- Visualize the free and forced response of SDOF and MDOF systems
- Calculate the mode ratios and eigenvalues of MDOF systems
- Derive the equation of motion of vibratory mechanisms
- Validate the theoretical equations obtained from Newton's Laws of Motion or Lagrange Equations through simulations

#### Learning Activities
Four laboratory handouts are created in MATLAB Live Editor. 
1. MATLAB Live Editor Practice
2. Vibration Isolation
3. Mode Ratios
4. Forced Vibrations
