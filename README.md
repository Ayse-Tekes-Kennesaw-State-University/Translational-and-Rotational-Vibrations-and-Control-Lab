# Translational and Rotational Vibrations and Control Lab
This repository includes translational, rotational, and control labs
You can download and run simulations on MATLAB R2021b or newer versions of MATLAB. You can also run simulations using MATLAB Online. The virtual labs can be utilized in undergraduate level Mechanical Vibrations, Control Theory and their associated laboratories.

#### The learning objectives that are tied to the virtual labs are:
- Determine the natural frequency of SDOF
- Determine the natural frequnecies of MDOF
- Observe how the initial displacement of each mass affects the free vibration for a system with multi degrees of freedom
- Design a dynamic absorber and test to see how well your design works
- Identify the benefits of an absorber design
- Visualize the free and forced response of SDOF and MDOF systems
- Calculate the mode ratios and eigenvalues of MDOF systems
- Derive the equation of motion of vibratory mechanisms
- Validate the theoretical equations obtained from Newton's Laws of Motion or Lagrange Equations through simulations

#### Learning Activities
Four laboratory handouts are created in MATLAB Live Editor. 
1. MATLAB Live Editor Practice
2. Vibration Isolation
3. Mode Ratios
4. Forced Vibrations
